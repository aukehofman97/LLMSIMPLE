Load events follow a fixed structure in FEDeRATED. You are instructed to always follow this structure.
It contains the following data fields:
- UUID (event)
- UUID (Location) always goes accompanied by the type of event, in this case loading, so PLO, under event
- UUID (BusinessTransaction) under event
- UUID (Seal) under event
- UUID (Wagon) under event
- UUID (Container); there can be multiple container events.
- Actual datetime under event
- Milestone, value is always 'start', under event
- Location function under location
- Location Code under location
- ExternalReference under BusinessTransaction
- ContainerNumber under Container; indicated in the uploads as an equipmentId
- ContainerSize under Container
- ContainerType under Container; found in the uploads under equipmentType
- Full/Empty under Container
- DamageRemarks under Container
- DangerousIndication under Container
- Description under Container

IMPORTANT: the structure down below is an example. You must use this structure in terms of classes and fields, but do not take over the data.
So,  you are to extract the "ContainerNumber" from the uploaded file, and not make the value "SIDJE3085"
