Arrival events follow a fixed structure in FEDeRATED. You are instructed to always follow this structure.
It contains the following data fields:
- UUID (event)
- UUID (Location) always goes accompanied by the type of event, in this case arrival, so ARR, under event
- UUID (BusinessTransaction) under event
- Actual datetime under event
- Milestone, value is always 'start', under event
- function under location
- locationCode under location
- ExternalReference under BusinessTransaction

IMPORTANT: the structure down below is an example. You must use this structure in terms of classes and fields, but do not take over the data.
So, you are to extract the "locationCode" from the uploaded file, and not make the value "62105"
